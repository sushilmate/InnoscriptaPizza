## Task Details
Let’s imagine you want to start a new pizza delivery business. Please create a small web application for online pizza
ordering. The idea is to make a non-existing service where assumed clients can choose a pizza, put it into a cart
and make an order.

### Requirements
1. The menu page should contain at least 8 pizzas - Status - Done
2. Login is not required but could be available for checking the history of orders.- Status - Done
3. Your clients should be able to choose pizzas directly from the menu- Status - Done
4. You can decide what else you want in the menu- Status - Done
5. Adding a description for each pizza would be a nice decision- Status - Done
6. Don’t proceed to the payment page. The last action from a client will be filling in the order form (address,
name, surname, etc.) to get a confirmation that the order has been received - Status - Done
7. A client should be able to put several pizzas into cart, and the quantity must be defined both while
outside the cart and in the cart - Status - Done
8. Total price of each order must be calculated and shown in euros and in dollars- Status - Done
9. Don’t forget to add delivery costs to the final bill- Status - Done
